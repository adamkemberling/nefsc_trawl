<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="encounter-temperatures-of-size-at-age-species">Encounter Temperatures of Size-at-Age Species</h3>
<p>Species encountering temperature changes may respond to a changing environment in a number of ways. One approach is that species may choose to change location to a more suitable environment. However; this approach may not be an option for all species. Certain species, and individuals of other species, may lack the mobility/awareness needed to relocate and must survive/persist in the new environment.</p>
<p>This document will look at the different temperatures that species have been caught at. Temperatures will be taken from the CTD casts deployed as part of the groundfish survey to take advantage of bottom temperatures.</p>
<p>The general hypothesis follows that species that are better able to track favorable temperatures should experience a lesser physiological toll than species that are unable to track temperature change. Changes in size-at-age should consequently be smaller in highly mobile species than less adaptable ones.</p>

<h1>Change Pathways</h1>
<p>Over the course of several years the mechanism by which a species may seek relief may change. This may be due to some sort of geographical restrictions that may limit the accessibility to deeper water, or some physical barriers that may prevent northward movements.</p>
<p>By displaying how both these axes have shifted through time it may help disclose how a species is moving and during which periods.</p>

<span id="cb17-29"><a href="#cb17-29" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Species encountering temperature changes may respond to a changing environment in a number of ways. One approach is that species may choose to change location to a more suitable environment. However; this approach may not be an option for all species. Certain species, and individuals of other species, may lack the mobility/awareness needed to relocate and must survive/persist in the new environment.</span>

<span id="cb17-31"><a href="#cb17-31" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>This document will look at the different temperatures that species have been caught at. Temperatures will be taken from the CTD casts deployed as part of the groundfish survey to take advantage of bottom temperatures.</span>
<span id="cb17-32"><a href="#cb17-32" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb17-33"><a href="#cb17-33" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The general hypothesis follows that species that are better able to track favorable temperatures should experience a lesser physiological toll than species that are unable to track temperature change. Changes in size-at-age should consequently be smaller in highly mobile species than less adaptable ones.</span>
