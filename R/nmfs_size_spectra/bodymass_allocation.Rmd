#  Patterns in Biomass Allocation

The following code digs into where the biomass is allocated among the 62 species sampled by the NE Groundfish Survey. Stratified abundances are used. Individual lengths and bodymasses are used to isolate what proportion of the overall abundances and biomasses reside.

Data is prepared and updated using {targets} to ensure a consistent data state and a reproducible workflow.

**Target Data**

Data for the report comes directly from the {targets} workflow found in `_targets.R`. For this markdown I'm loading in the results from the size spectrum slope analysis and the data that went into it so I can dig into any odd patterns I see. There is also regional SST based on the same trawl regions.

```{r}

# SS and manual bins together
withr::with_dir(rprojroot::find_root('_targets.R'), 
                tar_load(size_spectrum_indices))   

# Format Columns
size_spectrum_indices <- size_spectrum_indices  %>% 
  mutate(season = fct_rev(season),
         survey_area = factor(survey_area, 
                              levels = c("GoM", "GB", "SNE", "MAB")),

# Exploration of Abundance/Size Information {.tabset .tabset-pills}

The biological data was filtered prior to doing the size spectrum analysis so that any individuals smaller than 1g were removed. Then to dig into where the biomass andd abundances were distributed I've made some size bins to help tease out what the community looks like.

```{r}
# Cut up discrete length and weight bins
nefsc_size_bins <- nefsc_1g %>% 
  mutate(
    length_bin = case_when(
      length_cm <= 5   ~ "0 - 5cm",
      length_cm <= 10  ~ "5 - 10cm",
      length_cm <= 25  ~ "10 - 25cm",
      length_cm <= 50  ~ "25 - 50cm",
      length_cm <= 75  ~ "50 - 75cm",
      length_cm <= 100 ~ "75 - 100cm",
      length_cm >= 100 ~ ">= 100cm"),
    length_bin = factor(length_bin, levels = c(
      "0 - 5cm", "5 - 10cm", "10 - 25cm",
      "25 - 50cm", "50 - 75cm", "75 - 100cm", ">= 100cm")))


# Weight bins
nefsc_size_bins <- nefsc_size_bins %>% 
  mutate(
    weight_bin = case_when(
      ind_weight_kg <= 0.001 ~ "0 - 1g",
      ind_weight_kg <= 0.005 ~ "1 - 5g",

      ind_weight_kg <= 0.500 ~ "100 - 500g",
      ind_weight_kg <= 1.000 ~ ".5 - 1kg",

      ind_weight_kg <= 5.000 ~ "2 - 5kg",
      ind_weight_kg <= 10.00 ~ "5 - 10kg",
      ind_weight_kg >= 10.00 ~ ">= 10kg" ),
    weight_bin = factor(weight_bin, levels = c(
      "0 - 1g", "1 - 5g", "5 - 10g", "10 - 50g",
      "50 - 100g", "100 - 500g", ".5 - 1kg",
      "1 - 2kg", "2 - 5kg", "5 - 10kg", ">= 10kg")))


# Rename the functional groups
nefsc_size_bins <- nefsc_size_bins %>% 
  mutate(
    spec_class = case_when(
      spec_class == "gf"  ~ "Groundfish",
      spec_class == "pel" ~ "Pelagic",
      spec_class == "dem" ~ "Demersal",
      spec_class == "el"  ~ "Elasmobranch",
      spec_class == "<NA>" ~ "NA"))

# Make regions go N->S
nefsc_size_bins <- nefsc_size_bins %>% 
  mutate(survey_area = factor(survey_area, levels = c("GoM", "GB", "SNE", "MAB")),
         season = factor(season, levels = c("Spring", "Fall")))

```

**Group Summary Functions**

The following function is used to process the same numbers for each combination of factor groups without me rewriting the function over and over again.

```{r}

              total_strat_lw_bio = sum(strat_total_lwbio_s, na.rm = T), 
              .groups = "drop") 
  
  # length bins
  group_lengths <- nefsc_size_bins %>% 
    group_by(..., length_bin) %>%

  # weight bins
  group_weights <- nefsc_size_bins %>%

      perc_strat_abund  = (wtbin_strat_abund / total_strat_abund) * 100,
      perc_strat_lw_bio = (wtbin_strat_lw_bio / total_strat_lw_bio) * 100)

return(list("length_bins" = drop_na(group_lengths),
            "weight_bins" = drop_na(group_weights)))
}


# Process each group
regions <- get_group_summaries(Year, survey_area)
seasons <- get_group_summaries(Year, season)
fgroups <- get_group_summaries(Year, spec_class)
fishery <- get_group_summaries(Year, fishery)


```

**Same idea here, but for plotting them based on their groupings**

## Regional Differences {.tabset}

These first plots get at how the different regions compare to one another. Are we seeing striking patterns across them all simultaneously, or are there localized patterns that only occur in some of them.

```{r}
# Do some grouping
regions <- get_group_summaries(Year, survey_area)

```


### Length Bins


```{r}

# Get fraction for different length/weight classes

### Functional Group Key

Thought it may be helpful to have a table here to check which species are currently assigned to which group.

```{r}
# Display table of whichever specis fall into the categories
nefsc_size_bins %>% 
  distinct(comname, scientific_name, spec_class) %>%

  DT::datatable(filter = "top", rownames = FALSE)
```


## Fishery Status Diffferences {.tabset}


```{r}
# Do some grouping
fishery <- get_group_summaries(Year, fishery) 

```


### Length Bins


```{r}

# Get fraction for different length/weight classes

fish_lengths <- fishery$length_bins


```



```{r}

```



```{r}
abundance_by_bodymass(fish_weights, "fishery")

### Fishery Group Key

Thought it may be helpful to have a table here to check which species are currently assigned to which group.

```{r}
# Display table of whichever specis fall into the categories
nefsc_size_bins %>% 
  distinct(comname, scientific_name, fishery) %>%

# Community Size Spectra Results 

Community size spectrum slopes were estimated using 2 methods for comparison. An individual size distribution approach ISD developed by A. Edwards and using a more traditional method of binning biomass information into bins before fitting a slope to those bins.

The first method usezthe {sizeSpectra} package which were shown to be the most accurate when using simulated data compared to any of the binning methods. 

The second method uses binned abundances, with bodymass bins of width 0.5 on a log10 scale, so 10^0 - 10^0.5 etc. These bins were then normalized by dividing the abundances by the bin width to account for the increasing bin width.

Starting data used for both methods was the same. A minimum individual biomass of 1 gram was used to avoid issue with sampling biases for smaller individuals. Area-stratified total abundances (and their corresponding length-based biomasses) were used to preserve the importance of the sampling design. 



**Pull Results from Both Methods**

```{r}
# Pull the group ID for the slopes grouped on year, season, and region
warmem_group_slopes <- size_spectrum_indices %>% 
  filter(`group ID`== "single years * season * region")


# Or just regions and years
year_region_slopes <- size_spectrum_indices %>% 
  filter(`group ID` == "single years * region")
```

## Biomass Data to Match Size Spectrum Analysis {.tabset .tabset-pills}


### Region & Season

The first lens to look at is the seasonal variation across all the different areas. This was the typical grouping that we have been focusing on.

```{r}
# Do some grouping
warmem_totals <- get_group_summaries(Year, survey_area, season)

# # Stream Plot Version
# ggplot(warmem_totals$weight_bins, aes(Year, wtbin_strat_lw_bio, fill = weight_bin)) +
#   geom_stream(type = "ridge") +
#   facet_grid(survey_area~season) +
#   scale_fill_gmri()

ggplot(warmem_totals$weight_bins, 
       aes(Year, wtbin_strat_lw_bio, fill = weight_bin)) +
  geom_col(position = "stack", color = "gray80", size = 0.1) +
  facet_grid(survey_area~season, scales = "free") +
  scale_fill_gmri() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma_format()) +
  labs(y = "Stratified Total Biomass (kg)",  
       title = "Biomass Allocation by Weight",
       x = "", 
       fill = "Individual Weight (kg)")
```




### Region & Functional Group

The second lens that I feel is important is the functional groups. This is the not the typical grouping that we have been focusing on, but clears the air on where the biomass increase is coming from.

```{r}
# Do some grouping
fgroup_area <- get_group_summaries(Year, survey_area, spec_class)

ggplot(fgroup_area$weight_bins, 
       aes(Year, wtbin_strat_lw_bio, fill = weight_bin)) +
  geom_col(position = "stack", color = "gray80", size = 0.1) +
  facet_grid(survey_area~spec_class, scales = "free") +
  scale_fill_gmri() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma_format()) +
  labs(y = "Stratified Total Biomass (kg)",  
       title = "Biomass Allocation by Weight",
       x = "", 
       fill = "Individual Weight (kg)")
```

## Edwards Methodology {.tabset .tabset-pills}

The Edwards methodology differs from the other methods for estimating size spectra by avoiding the subjective decisions around how to bin data prior to fitting the log-linear regression.

Instead, Edwards uses the individual size distributions (how many individuals of any given length/weight). Abundances are totaled into discrete size bins based on expected biomass at length and length + 1, and individuals that fall within those bins are totaled to get abundances across a continuous distribution of individual bodymass. 

The next difference is that the individual body size data is presumed to follow a bounded power-law distribution, with a minimum and maximum body size. Using the individual size data,  maximum likelihood estimation is used to solve for the parameter (b) that minimizes the negative log-likelihood.


### Year and Region Only

### Odd Years {.tabset}

In the previous figure, for Georges Bank there are a number of years when b is close to -1.2 that do not follow the rest of the trend.  These occur on 1974 and 1980. This section exists to see why that is:

```{r}
# Find the years
odd_years <- warmem_group_slopes %>% 
  filter(survey_area == "GB", 
         b < -1.2) %>% 
  split(.$Year)

# Find the data
odd_year_dat <- nefsc_size_bins %>% 
  filter(survey_area == "GB",
         Year %in% c(1974, 1980),
         season == "Fall") %>% 
  split(.$Year)
```

#### Individual Size Distribution

The individual size distribution plots look like a lot but are not too complicated with a little explanation.

The blue bars are the width of what a given species biomass can be based on. What the species is, and its L-W relationship. Since fishes are measured to the nearest cm the left bound is the biomass for that length, and the right bound is how much mass it could also have before jumping into the next 1cm increment.

The height of the blue bars indicate how many individuals fall within that size range. Eventually building up the range of possible sizes caught, and how many there are/were.

The red line is a bounded power law fit to those blue lines. The power law relationship between abundance and size is the foundation for all the size spectra methods, in this case individual sizes are used rather than the more typical larger bins.

**Data Prep**

```{r}
# ISD plot preparation
# counts how many of each size there are with overlapping sizes counting
# towards the discrete size bins when possible
isd_prepped <- map(odd_year_dat, ~ isd_plot_prep(as.data.frame(.x),
                                                stratified_abundance = T,
                                                min_weight_g = 1))

```

**Individual Size Distributions**

Like any of these methods sometimes the assumed relationship does not perfectly fit the data. In the case of these two years there appears to be in the 10g-1kg range.

```{r}
isd_1974 <- ggplot_isd(isd_data_prepped = isd_prepped$`1974`, 
                       mle_results = odd_years$`1974`, 
                       abundance_vals = "stratified", 
                       plot_rects = FALSE, 
                       show_pl_fit = TRUE, 
                       group_name = "1974, Fall, GB")$obs_y

isd_1980 <- ggplot_isd(isd_data_prepped = isd_prepped$`1980`, 
                       mle_results = odd_years$`1974`, 
                       abundance_vals = "stratified", 
                       plot_rects = FALSE, 
                       show_pl_fit = TRUE, 
                       group_name = "1980, Fall, GB")$obs_y

isd_1974 / isd_1980

```

#### Binned Biomass

If I plot the same data using the binning approach you still see that the bins that cover 10^1 through 10^3 grams are higher than the fit line (analogous to red line for ISD). But, because the size distribution is no longer continuous, you can potentially run into issues of bins not accurately representing the data that goes into them.

```{r}

# Log10 binning, 0.5 increments on log10 scale
# assign bins
l10_assigned <- map(odd_year_dat, ~ assign_log10_bins(.x))

# plot bin structure for survey abundance and stratified abundance
l10_1974 <- plot_log10_ss(l10_assigned = l10_assigned$`1974`) 
l10_1980 <- plot_log10_ss(l10_assigned = l10_assigned$`1980`) 


# Grab just the stratified abundance one
l10_1974[[2]] + labs(title = "1974, Fall, GB") |
l10_1980[[2]] + labs(title = "1980, Fall, GB")
```

  geom_line(aes(group = survey_area), linetype = 3) +

              alpha = 0.2) +

### Fit Statistics (adjusted r-squared) 

For each of the slope/intercepts derived using a linear model and binned data I also pulled the adjusted r-square to get a sense of whether or not certain groups had poor fits that should be investigated.

```{r}
# Reshaping
# Goal: Row for Years, columns for each different group
l10_fit_dat <- warmem_group_slopes %>% 
  select(Year, season, survey_area, l10_slope_strat, l10_int_strat, l10_rsqr_strat) %>% 
  mutate(yr = as.numeric(Year))


l10_fit_dat %>% 
  ggplot(aes(yr, l10_rsqr_strat, color = survey_area)) +
  geom_rect(xmin = -Inf, xmax = Inf, ymin = 0, ymax = 0.2, 
            fill = "gray80", color = "transparent") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.2, linetype = 2, size = 0.5, color = "gray50") +
  geom_line(aes(group = survey_area), linetype = 3) +

# External Drivers

Several external forces have been suggested as both drivers and/or contributors to changes in the composition of the Northeast Shelf fish community.

Among them are:
 * Changes in temperature regimes   
 * Historical fishing removal   
 * Climate Oscillations
 * Trophic Cascades
 
Each of these have different time horizons and periodicities associated with them. This timeline aims to place them on a common timeline to see the agreement or alignment between competing factors.

Historical periods related to fishing gear changes and the decline of the groundfish fishery can be found here:[A brief History of the Groundfishing Industry of New England](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/commercial-fishing/brief-history-groundfishing-industry-new-england#period-2.-cod-to-haddock-(1920-1930))
