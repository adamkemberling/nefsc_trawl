# Size Spectrum of the Northeast US Groundfish Community

# Introduction

This is a direct quote:

> Temperature is the most important physical factor affecting processes at multiple scales of organization from cellular chemical reaction rates, organismal physiological processes, population productivity and distribution, and interactions among species in complex communities (Fry 1971, Magnuson et al. 1979, Claireaux and Lefran√ßois 2007).

Temperature related effects on marine organism physiology impacts:

1.  The acquisition of biomass through feeding

2.  The loss of biomass through metabolism

3.  The rates of development

**Intuition behind size spectrum:**

Physical environments set the potential for bottom-up productivity. Lower productivity communities (with exceptions) support less complex food webs. Community interactions (ex. growth & predation) transfer energy through the ecosystem. Inefficient transfer of energy produces steeper slopes and/or fewer trophic levels. Disturbances to the community impact the flow of energy from smaller to larger organisms. Physical removal of specific size classes directly impacts slope by impacting the energy transfer from prey to predator.

### Size Spectrum Theory

A "size spectrum" describes the relationship between size (length or body mass) and abundances within a community.

### Temperature of the Gulf of Maine & NE Shelf

Sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Maine since 1982 have been warming at rates faster than 96% of the world's oceans, with similar warming rates along the northwest Atlantic shelf [@pershing2018]. A punctuated elevation in temperatures over the last decade are believed to be the result of a shift in Gulf Stream positioning. A Northward shift in the Gulf stream has increased the regional temperatures via an increased direct transport of warm gulf stream water into areas like the Gulf of Maine . The Gulf stream has also been producing a higher frequency of warm core rings, and has obstructed some of the cold-water Scotian Shelf current flow that would otherwise counter the influence of the Gulf Stream on the region's temperatures [@gangopadhyay2019; @meyer-gutbrod2021]. The combination of these oceanographic changes has led to a warmer continental shelf habitat.

### Species Trends in NE Shelf

The observed warming in the northwest Atlantic has been shown to be a major factor in the redistribution of marine species along the US east coast. Species have responded to these warming trends by adjusting the timing and locations of their seasonal migrations and shifting their geographic ranges [@nye2009; @staudinger2019]. There is also evidence that warming has hampered fisheries recoveries through its physiological impacts on growth and metabolism. Species like Black Sea Bass, Atlantic shortfin squid, and Blue crab have been high-profile examples of species expanding their ranges to follow their thermal preferences. While species like the American lobster have shown declines at their southern range near Long Island Sound, with much doubt whether they will recover under the present temperature trends. The recent regime shift in the physical oceanography has also shown to be a catalyst for biological shifts as well [@meyer-gutbrod2021; @perretti2017].

While these examples show that species can respond to changes in the physical environment around them through movement & behavior, research elsewhere suggests that physiological responses integrated across species will manifest as changes in community size structure.

### Purpose

We estimated size spectrum relationships for the groundfish populations for each sub-region of the Northeast US continental shelf.

# Methods

## Groundfish Data

```{r survdat_data}
# 1. Biological data used as input
withr::with_dir(rprojroot::find_root('_targets.R'), 
                tar_load(nefsc_1g_labelled))   

# rename and format
nefsc_size_bins <- nefsc_1g_labelled

n_species <- length(unique(nefsc_size_bins$comname))
```

Fishery Independent data on was collected as part of the NEFSC's northeast trawl survey. This survey is conducted each year in the spring and in the fall, with sample locations determined following a stratified-random survey design with effort allocated in proportion to stratum area. Analyses using the trawl survey data took used data from both the Spring and Fall survey seasons covering all years from 1970 to 2019. Correction factors were applied to total species abundance and biomass to account for changes in vessels, gear, and doors when appropriate as part of the survey program. However, abundance and biomass by length is not corrected. To account for this, abundance at length for each species were adjusted to match the correction factors applied to total species abundance at each station, with allocation following the distributions of length caught at that station. Such that for each species: the sum of adjusted abundances for each length class is equal to the gross abundance as corrected for changes in vessels, gear, etc. To account for differences in sampling effort among survey strata, all corrected abundance-at-length data was area-stratified.

Data from the survey was grouped by strata to form geographically meaningful sub-regions: Gulf of Maine, Georges Bank, Southern New England, Mid-Atlantic Bight.

```

### Size Spectrum Analysis

Community size spectra were estimated using abundance-at-length data from `r n_species` species. These species were selected based on the availability of published weight-at-length relationships (Wigley et al. 2003) and represented 98.98% of the total biomass caught in the survey. Published length-weight relationships were then used to convert abundance at length data into an estimated biomass at length (kg) to complement the corrected abundances-at-length data which had been area stratified. The area-stratified biomass at length information was then used for fitting each regional size spectra.

Stratified biomass at length data was then binned into equally spaced intervals or 0.5 on a $log_{10}$ scale, summing bodymass across all species within each body size bin. Stratified abundance within each bin was then divided by the bin-width to account for the increasing bin-widths, a consequence of the log scale. Normalized size spectra were then fit for each year and for each region independently, and for each year across all strata, using ordinary least squares (ols) regressions for stratified abundance (normalized) by body-size bins.

```{r spectrum_results}
withr::with_dir(rprojroot::find_root('_targets.R'), 
                tar_load(size_spectrum_indices))   

# Format Columns
yearly_indices <- size_spectrum_indices  %>% 
  filter(`group ID` == "single years") %>% 
  mutate(yr = as.numeric(as.character(Year)),
         sig_fit = ifelse(l10_sig_strat < 0.05, "Significant", "Non-Significant"))


# Plot 3 panels:
# ISD exponent
isd_timeline <- ggplot(yearly_indices, aes(yr, b)) +
  geom_line(linetype = 2) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y~x) +
  labs(x = "", y = "ISD Exponent\n(b)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())

# Normalized Size Spectrum Slope
slope_timeline <- ggplot(yearly_indices, aes(yr, l10_slope_strat)) +
  geom_line(linetype = 2) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_gmri() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y~x) +
  labs(x = "", y = "Spectrum\nSlope") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())

# Size Spectrum Intercept
int_timeline <- ggplot(yearly_indices, aes(yr, l10_int_strat)) +
  geom_line(linetype = 2) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y~x) +
  labs(x = "", y = "Spectrum\nIntercept") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())


# Assemble
isd_timeline / slope_timeline / int_timeline + plot_annotation(title = "All Regions Size Spectra")
```

### Abundance and Size Trends

This is exploratory stuff, but I feel like it is impactful

```{r all_year_bin_summaries}

# make a column that contains all data
nefsc_size_bins <- nefsc_size_bins %>% 
  mutate(group_col = "All Data") 

# run summary
all_data_summs <- get_group_summaries(Year, group_col)
```

### Body Size Trends

Similar thing here, the change in average size goes simultaneously with increased abundances

```{r}

```

## Temperature Data

Global Sea surface temperature data was obtained via NOAA's optimally interpolated SST analysis (OISSTv2), providing daily temperature values at a 0.25¬∞ latitude x 0.25¬∞ longitude resolution (Reynolds et al. 2007). A daily climatology for every 0.25¬∞ pixel in the global data set was created using average daily temperatures spanning the period of 1982-2011. Daily anomalies were then computed as the difference between observed temperatures and the daily climatological average. OISSTv2 data used in these analyses were provided by the NOAA PSL, Boulder, Colorado, USA from their website at https://psl.noaa.gov.

Temperature data was regionally averaged to match the sampling area for the fisheries independent survey program providing the age-at-length data. SST anomalies were averaged by year for each sub-region and over the entire sampling region to produce a daily time series. This time series was then processed into an annual timeseries of surface temperatures and anomalies. All area-averaging was done with area-weighting to account for differences in the relative areas of the latitude/longitude grid of the OISSTv2 data.

```{r}

# Load the regional temperatures from {targets}
withr::with_dir(rprojroot::find_root('_targets.R'), 
                tar_load(regional_oisst))

```

## Spectra Drivers
